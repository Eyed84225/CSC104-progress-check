    Hi, my name is Taren Miller. I wanted to make this site because most review sites I've
    seen have often been bought out by the developers
    from the games they are going to review and thus
    aren't providing honest reviews about most of the new
    game releases. That is why I made this site. To provide 
    an objective review of games and movies and let you, the reader, 
    have a truthful review. So let's dance Jack, and not Jinx the message,
    <br>
    Signed, Eyed M
