        The Safe House rates games on the story and how immersive the story was, how fun the gameplay was and if the gameplay offered something new to the player
        Lastly, I view the game as if I'm completly new to the seris, that way, if you want to pick up the game,
        you know what it's gonna be like.</h4></td>

        As a gamer for several years, I have often come across new game releases that are quite boring and when I look online, the game has a 10/10 review from other review sites.
        But when I look at what users are rating the game, like on youtube or steam reviews, they are also saying it's boring. So I wanted to make a site that was truely transpartant
        on how well the game/movie was and show where the flaws lie, whether in cinema or in the gaming industry.</td>
        
        <td style="background-image: url(Arcane.jpg);"><h2>Movie Reviews</h2><br><h4>
        The Safe House rates moives/show on how interesting the plot is, how interesting the characters are, and how well the movie/show end, if they have ended.
        That way, you know what you are getting into and can get involved if you haven't watched the show.</h4></td>
