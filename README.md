This is a progress check for my final project for CSC104. The index or home page has outputs leading to the game and movie reviews as well as an about me page and copyright reference page to ensure the images i use are properly credited. The review pages have links to the item they are reviewing such as an Arcane review or Metal Gear Rising review. The reviews themselves lead to sites to either buy the game or buy a subscription to be able to watch Arcane. Lastly, the about me doesn't have any outputs except to the home page or review home pages but the reference page also includes links to the places where I got my images.
